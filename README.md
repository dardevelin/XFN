XFN - XCHAT FRIEND NOTIFY v1.0
===

This is an xchat plugin written in C which add's a 
custom notification system to a selected list of
nicknames/users across the channels you are logged in.

Xchat already provides in it's options a way to use system
notifications for private messages and highlights or pm's and you
rather prefer to get only balloon notifiations from few contacts.

This plugin also allows you to choose between seeing the full
message on the notification balloon, or just the nick
that messaged you. You know, for those moments you are not alone, 
or recording something :)
