This file contains a list of tasks that are intented to be
executed in order to improve the plugin

use xchat_nickcmp instead of nickname_cmp 
^ probably requires dbsglinked list to be modified

attemp to drop dbsglinked for a better data structure, or 
use a point system with it, so the nicknames are sorted in order
to reduce search time and improve plugin usability

add a way to save settings and store the xfn_list across sessions

add documentation to github repo
build debian package with auto installation of the plugin

As suggested by TingPing 
use /tray -b and not libnotify directly in order to improve portability
and allow other plugins to hook into it
